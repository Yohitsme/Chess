// TODO

// A: Affecting ongoing dev, bugs that slow progress and distract, current priority development
-Null Move Search reductions causing exceptions, as well as en passent checking is not handling the null move well
-Mate/checks need to count in quiescent search, not just captures

// B: Annoying bugs. Features that could help a lot
-The AI doesn't quantify king safety other than castling early


// C: Features that would be nice and optimize code for later. 
-Finish adding bonuses/penalties in AI
-Passive processing
-Ability to undo a move
-Ability to click forward and backward through the game

// User feedback:
Joe:
-It's still very materialistic throughout the early and mid game but then in the end game it's very eager to exchange even if it's losing.
-It just allowed a very simple mate. Definitely needs a "protect from mate at all costs" mode
-It has run really well!  Aside from the very bold non castling games it hasn't made any bad moves that I've seen.
