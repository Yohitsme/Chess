// TODO

// A: Affecting ongoing dev, bugs that slow progress and distract, current priority development
-Null Move Search reductions causing exceptions, as well as en passent checking is not handling the null move well
-AI still thinks moving queen out early is strong. Need to look into this since there are penalties in place for this behaviour but it persists.
-Piece lists are off...it seems like more pawns get added back after capturing than there should be. This is leading to incorrect material counts and bad scoring overall

// B: Bugs that really cause big problems with dev. Features that could help a lot
-The AI doesn't quantify king safety other than castling early

// C: Features that would be nice and optimize code for later. 
-Finish adding bonuses/penalties in AI
-Multithreading instead of event driven
-Passive processing
